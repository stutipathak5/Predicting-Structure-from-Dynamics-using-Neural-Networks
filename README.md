# Predicting-Structure-from-Dynamics-using-Neural-Networks


Predicted the structure of an unknown dynamical system given its time series data using machine learning. Neural network was trained to perform binary classification for two classes of networks: scale free networks and Erdosâ€“Renyi random networks.
